// Why XML?

/*
 * If you want to save the state and you save the object in data format
 * and after saving you deserialize it
 * and in that time gap that class structure change it shows error
 * so what we do 
 * instead of storing it in data format
 * we can use XML
 * since it is one of the most efficient data storage
